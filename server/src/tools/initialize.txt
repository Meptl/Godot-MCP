Here are some notes for effectively using Godot-MCP:
- Prefer Godot's Container systems such as VBoxContainer over absolute UI element positioning
- When referencing paths for UI elements prefer "Access by Unique Name", be sure to set unique_name_in_owner on the node.
- Instance values override script defaults: @export variables set in the
  scene editor override the script's default values, check the actual scene
  instance properties when debugging mismatches
- Prefer signals for communication between nodes
- You must call godot-mcp:save_scene after modifying the scene through godot-mcp
- For Object fields (like fonts), call initialize_property on the field
