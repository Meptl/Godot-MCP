- Prefer Godot's Container systems such as VBoxContainer over absolute UI element positioning
- When referencing paths for UI elements prefer "Access by Unique Name"
- Instance values override script defaults: @export variables set in the
  scene editor override the script's default values, check the actual scene
  instance properties when debugging mismatches
- Prefer signals for communication between nodes
